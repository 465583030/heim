# Overview

Clients interact with Euphoria over a WebSocket-based API. The connection is to a specific
*room*. We call each instance of such a connection a *session*.

## Packets

Messages are sent back and forth between the client and server as packets, in the form of JSON objects.
Each packet has the following structure:


| Field | Type | Required? | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :--------- |
| `id` | [string](#string) | *optional* |  client-generated id for associating replies with commands |
| `type` | [PacketType](#packettype) | required |  the name of the command, reply, or event |
| `data` | object | *optional* |  the payload of the command, reply, or event |
| `error` | [string](#string) | *optional* |  this field appears in replies if a command fails |
| `throttled` | [bool](#bool) | *optional* |  this field appears in replies to warn the client that it may be flooding; the client should slow down its command rate |
| `throttled_reason` | [string](#string) | *optional* |  if throttled is true, this field describes why |




The `type` field determines the type of the `data` field. Packet types come in three flavors:

1. *Commands*. These names have no suffix. Examples: "[ping](#ping)", "[send](#send)"
2. *Replies*. Every command type has a corresponding reply type. Their names all have a `-reply` suffix. Examples: "[ping-reply](#ping)", "[send-reply](#send)"
3. *Events*. These names all have an `-event` suffix. Examples: "[snapshot-event](#snapshot-event)", "[ping-event](#ping-event)"

Almost all client-to-server packets must be commands. The only exception is [ping-reply](#ping),
which the client should send in response to a [ping-event](#ping-event) from the server.
Any other reply or event sent by the client will have an error reply sent back in response.

All server-to-client packets must be either replies or events. All replies must correspond to a command
sent by the client. The server must never send more than one reply to a command.

When a client sends a command, it can choose to specify an `id`. This is an arbitrary string that
the server will include in its reply. This helps asynchronous clients identify which command a packet
is in reply to.

Here is an example [send](#send) command sent from a client to the server:

```
{
 "id": "1",
 "type": "send",
 "data": {
  "content": "hello world!"
 }
}
```

In response, the server will send back a [send-reply](#send):

```
{
 "id": "1",
 "type": "send-reply",
 "data": {
  "id": "00gd6yy9hvksg",
  "time": 1418585715,
  "sender": {
   "id": "agent:4da8fa7375215589",
   "name": "logan",
   "server_id": "heim.1",
   "server_era": "00g5fdwjzl91c",
   "session_id": "4da8fa7375215589-00000246"
  },
  "content": "hello world!"
 }
}
```

The server will also send a [send-event](#send-event) to all the other sessions connected
to the same room:

```
{
 "type": "send-event",
 "data": {
  "id": "00gd6yy9hvksg",
  "time": 1418585715,
  "sender": {
   "id": "agent:4da8fa7375215589",
   "name": "logan",
   "server_id": "heim.1",
   "server_era": "00g5fdwjzl91c",
   "session_id": "4da8fa7375215589-00000246"
  },
  "content": "hello world!"
 }
}
```

## Initial Handshake

When a client connects to the websocket for a room, the server will begin the session
with a [ping-event](#ping-event):

```
{
 "type": "ping-event",
 "data": {
  "time": 1428979816,
  "next": 1428979846
 }
}
```

The client should immediately reply with the same timestamp:

```
{
 "type": "ping-reply",
 "data": {
  "time": 1428979816
 }
}
```

Once the client replies to the ping, one of two possible events will be sent next.
If the room is a public room, or if the client is logged into an account that has
been granted access to the room, then the server will send a [snapshot-event](#snapshot-event):

```
{
  type: "snapshot-event",
  data: {
    identity: "agent:4da8fa7375215589",
    session_id: "4da8fa7375215589-00000246",
    version: "801ea89a4e410b11410eb61c91971439904e66c0",
    listing: [...],
    log:[...]
  }
}
```

This event serves to fill the client in on recent room history, and lists all the sessions
currently joined in the room. From this point on, the session is *joined* with the room. A
joined session may use chat commands and will receive room events.

If the room is private and the client does not have access, the server will send a
[bounce-event](#bounce-event) instead. At this point the client should obtain the
proper authentication credentials from the user and present them with the [auth](#auth)
or [login](#login) command.

# Field Types

This section describes all the field types one can expect to see in packets.

### bool

A boolean value: `true` or `false`.

# Commands and Replies

As described in the [Overview](#overview), there are a number of commands that the
client may send to the server. For each such command, there is a corresponding reply
that the server will send in return.

## Session Management

Session management commands are involved in the initial handshake and maintenance of a session.

### send

The `send` command sends a message to a room. The session must be
successfully joined with the room. This message will be broadcast to
all sessions joined with the room.

If the room is private, then the message content will be encrypted
before it is stored and broadcast to the rest of the room.

The caller of this command will not receive the corresponding
`send-event`, but will receive the same information in the `send-reply`.

messages may be undeleted by this command. (Messages that have expired from
the database due to the room's retention policy are no longer available and
cannot be restored by this or any command).

If the `announce` field is set to true, then an edit-message-event will be
broadcast to the room.
